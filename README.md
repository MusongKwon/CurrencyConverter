# TravelAssistant
This app is designed for a user base of people who are looking to travel internationally.
There are many things to note before visiting another country and TravelAssitant will help travellers decide where to go.

TravelAssistant consists of three pages: the homepage, the destination page, and the information page

The Homepage

This page welcomes users and asks the user for their residence. This residence can be either a country or a dependency of another country.
